#Introduction
For our final deliverable we have successfully created a working application for
the fictional Clark County Library. As a team we were able to develop a design for both the
frontend and backend of the app, and then divide up the coding to produce the product
we envisioned. Our application allows different types of users to login and see different
views. When a user logs in, the code will detect what type of user they are and display
the correct screen. If a contestant logs in to the application, they will be able to submit
an entry to any contest available and also have the ability to view entries that they have
submitted to. The judge will be able to give a first, second, or third place ratings to the
contests with entries that have been submitted. While the Admin has the ability to view
all the entries that have been submitted and also create new contests for contestants.
